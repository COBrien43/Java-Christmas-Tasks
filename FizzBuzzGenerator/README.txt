TODO-

Added output for each test using System.out.println

using assert equals plus a expectedName to help with println, and also to contain the string that is correct

using assert true and false

changed the ==2 to ==0

talk about JUnit and how we psuedo coded it, knowing we need an input and an expected output in order to conduct the test
